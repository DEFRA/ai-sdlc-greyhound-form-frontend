Below is a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a GOV.UK–style website that replicates the greyhound racetrack welfare licence application form (as seen in citeturn0file0). The design follows progressive enhancement principles (with each question on its own page) and leverages a MongoDB back end with a Node.js API.

# 1. Overview

**Project Title:**  
Greyhound Racetrack Welfare Licence Application Website

**Objective:**  
To build a user-friendly, accessible web application in the GOV.UK style that replicates the existing greyhound racetrack welfare licence form. The site will use progressive enhancement so that users interact with one question per page (wizard-style) and can save and resume their work later. The back end is built with Node.js, and data is stored in MongoDB.

---

# 2. Goals & Success Metrics

- **User-Centric Design:**  
  Provide an accessible and straightforward experience using GOV.UK GDS components.
- **Progressive Enhancement:**  
  Each question is presented on a dedicated page to minimize cognitive load and improve mobile responsiveness.

- **Data Persistence:**  
  Users can create a new form instance, name it, and later retrieve and complete the form.

- **Robust Backend:**  
  A RESTful Node.js API backed by MongoDB ensures scalability, security, and ease of maintenance.

- **Compliance & Accessibility:**  
  Ensure the application meets GOV.UK accessibility standards and secure data handling best practices.

_Success Metrics:_

- Completion rate of forms
- User session recovery (number of resumed incomplete forms)
- Page load performance and mobile responsiveness
- Compliance audit results for accessibility and security

# 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. User Interface & Experience

- **Wizard-Style Form Flow:**

  - The form is split into multiple pages, each displaying one question (or a small group of related questions) to streamline input.
  - Navigation controls include “Next”, “Previous”, and a summary/review page before final submission.
  - Use of GOV.UK Design System components (typography, forms, buttons, etc.) to ensure consistency and accessibility.

- **Save & Resume Functionality:**

  - Users can name their form instance and save progress.
  - A “Save for later” button is available on each page.
  - On return, users see a dashboard listing their saved forms and can resume editing.

- **Validation & Feedback:**

  - Inline form validation and error messages using GDS style.
  - Client-side and server-side validation to ensure data integrity.

- **Responsive & Accessible:**
  - The design will be mobile-first, ensuring proper scaling.
  - Conforms to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines and GOV.UK accessibility recommendations.

### 3.2. Form Content

Based on the source form (citeturn0file0), the form includes the following sections and questions:

- **Applicant Details:**

  - Racetrack name, applicant name, addresses, contact details.
  - Disqualification check (Yes/No) with a conditional text area for details.
  - Date of application.

- **Licensing Conditions (Grouped by Condition):**
  1. Veterinary surgeon agreement, anticipated dates, contact details.
  2. Facilities for the attending veterinary surgeon.
  3. Kennel availability.
  4. Greyhound identification.
  5. Record keeping for greyhounds and their owners/trainers.
  6. Injury records and anticipated compliance timeline.

Each of these questions is shown on its own page (or broken into a few pages if necessary for lengthy text or multiple inputs).

# 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1. Frontend

- **Technology Stack:**

  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
  - Use of a modern framework (e.g., React, Vue, or plain JS enhanced progressively) that supports the GOV.UK Design System.
  - Progressive enhancement: even if JavaScript is disabled, server-rendered pages allow the form to be completed sequentially.

- **Routing & Navigation:**

  - Frontend routes:
    - `/` – Home/Dashboard with options to create a new form or resume a saved form.
    - `/form/new` – Form creation page where the user can assign a name to a new form.
    - `/form/:id/page/:pageNumber` – Each page of the form.
    - `/form/:id/review` – A final review page before submission.
    - `/form/:id/confirmation` – Submission confirmation page.

- **GDS Components:**
  - Use GDS standard components for forms, buttons, error messages, and navigation.
  - Ensure consistency with spacing, typography, and accessible error feedback.

### 4.2. Backend

- **Technology Stack:**

  - Node.js with an Express.js server.
  - RESTful API design for CRUD operations on forms.
  - MongoDB as the primary data store.

- **API Routes (RESTful):**

  **Form Management:**

  - **POST /api/forms**
    - Create a new form instance.
    - Request Body: Form name, initial applicant details (optional).
    - Response: Newly created form ID and metadata.
  - **GET /api/forms**

    - Retrieve a list of saved forms for the user.
    - Query parameters might include pagination or filtering (e.g., status: in-progress, submitted).

  - **GET /api/forms/:formId**

    - Retrieve a specific form by ID.
    - Includes form data across all pages.

  - **PUT /api/forms/:formId**

    - Update a form with new answers or progress.
    - Request Body: Updated data for the current page.
    - Response: Updated form object.

  - **POST /api/forms/:formId/submit**
    - Finalize and submit the form.
    - Server-side validation is performed.
    - Response: Confirmation and any next steps.

- **Security & Validation:**
  - Input sanitization and validation on both client and server.
  - Authentication and session management if required (for saved forms).
  - API rate limiting and secure headers.

# 5. Data Model (MongoDB Schema)

Below is an example MongoDB data model in Mongoose-like schema definition:

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const Schema = mongoose.Schema

const FormSchema = new Schema({
  formName: { type: String, required: true },
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['in-progress', 'submitted'],
    default: 'in-progress'
  },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  updatedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  pages: {
    applicantDetails: {
      racetrackName: { type: String },
      applicantName: { type: String },
      applicantAddress: { type: String },
      applicantPostcode: { type: String },
      racetrackAddress: { type: String },
      racetrackPostcode: { type: String },
      telephone: { type: String },
      email: { type: String },
      disqualified: { type: Boolean },
      disqualificationDetails: { type: String },
      applicationDate: { type: Date }
    },
    licensingConditions: {
      condition1: {
        hasVetAgreement: { type: Boolean },
        anticipatedAgreementDate: { type: Date },
        vetContact: { type: String },
        hasVetRegister: { type: Boolean },
        anticipatedRegisterDate: { type: Date }
      },
      condition2: {
        facilitiesReady: { type: Boolean },
        anticipatedFacilitiesDate: { type: Date }
      },
      condition3: {
        kennelsReady: { type: Boolean },
        anticipatedKennelsDate: { type: Date }
      },
      condition4: {
        greyhoundIdentified: { type: Boolean },
        anticipatedIdentificationDate: { type: Date }
      },
      condition5: {
        recordsKept: { type: Boolean },
        anticipatedRecordsDate: { type: Date }
      },
      condition6: {
        injuryRecordsKept: { type: Boolean },
        anticipatedInjuryRecordsDate: { type: Date }
      }
    }
    // Additional sections can be added here if needed.
  }
})

module.exports = mongoose.model('Form', FormSchema)
```

_Note:_ The schema above is a starting point. It can be extended with more fields, indexes, and relations as the application evolves.
